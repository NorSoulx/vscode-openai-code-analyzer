# Visual Studio Code OpenAI Code Analyzer

The "vscode-openai-code-analyzer" is a Visual Studio Code extension that leverages OpenAI GPT technology to analyze and summarize code snippets in various programming languages. It also performs a code review. This is configurable thru the contents of the system, assistent and user roles (see Configuration section below).

## Features

This revamped extension now includes:

- Improved user interaction with the **Summarize Code** and **OpenAI Code Analyzer Settings** commands.
- More comprehensive code analysis and summarization by utilizing a role-based message system in OpenAI API calls.
- Enhanced configurability with options to specify the GPT model and customize the content of system, assistant, and user prompts.
- A new Markdown preview feature that renders the summary, token usage, and other relevant information in a well-formatted Markdown document.
- Error handling improvements to provide more informative error messages.
- Progress reporting during the summarization process.


## Requirements

To use this extension, you need an OpenAI API key. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key value. For example:
```
cd /mysrc/
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
code .
```
## Usage

1. Select the code snippet you want to analyze in the editor.
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type "Summarize Code" and press Enter.

The extension will send the selected code to the OpenAI API, and the summary along with other relevant information will be displayed in a new Markdown preview pane.

## Configuration

You can configure the following settings in Visual Studio Code:

- `openaiCodeAnalyzer.maxTokens`: Set the maximum number of tokens for the code summary generated by OpenAI API (default is 600).
- `openaiCodeAnalyzer.gptModel`: Specify the GPT model to use with the OpenAI API (default is "gpt-4").
- `openaiCodeAnalyzer.roleSystemContent`: Customize the content for the system role message.
- `openaiCodeAnalyzer.roleAssistantContent`: Customize the content for the assistant role message.
- `openaiCodeAnalyzer.roleUserContent`: Customize the content for the user role message.

To access these settings, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
2. Type "OpenAI Code Analyzer Settings" and press Enter. This will open settings for this extension where you can override VS Code's settings with your own.
